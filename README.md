# Cascade
**A minimalistic and keyboard centered userChrome**

Cascade aims to remove a lot of the subjective clutter default Firefox comes with. The theme is also highly inspired by the stylistic choices of [SimpleFox](https://github.com/migueravila/SimpleFox) ü¶ä by [Miguel √Åvila](https://github.com/migueravila).

This theme was known previously as ¬ª*ag.proton*¬´ ‚Äî but let's be honest: That sounds hella boring. What you get is a really simple adaptive layout that works well with the new Proton UI. By default ‚Äî on larger screen resolutions ‚Äì Cascade will transition to a Oneline layout which displays the URL Bar and Tab Bar next to each other. Smaller resultions will stack both UI elements on top of each other for better readability.
